# Hybrid-Memetic-Algorithm-For-Multi-dimensional-Knapsack-Problems
## Introduction
This project delivers comprehensive formulation and solution to one of the most famous NP-complete problems: multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP) with C. The solution is based on memetic algorithm which is common as an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm.
